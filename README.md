# PathSim
PathSim is a 2D based robotic environment simulation. It has been create for learning purposes, specifically in relation to a course im taking called **Motion Planning and Path Planning**. It has been created as a lighter and simpler alternative to **WeBots**

## Overview  
PathSim is a lightweight Python-based simulation tool for testing and visualizing path planning algorithms. It includes:  

- A **2D world** with obstacles, a robot, a start point, and a goal.  
- A robot with **sensors** to detect obstacles and measure distances.  
- Support for user implemented **path planning algorithms**.
